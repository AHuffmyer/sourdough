# Ariana's sourdough naan bread

*This recipe makes stretchy and soft naan bread using active starter. It's my favorite naan to make with homemade Indian lamb madras and lentil daal!*

## Ingredients

For the dough: 

- 125 g active sourdough starter (you can also use unfed discard, but it may not rise as much) 
- 300 g all purpose flour
- 120 g milk (dairy or non-dairy is fine, I like using whole milk) 
- 60 g plain yogurt (I use non-fat Greek yogurt)
- 15 g olive oil
- 7 g sea salt

For toppings after cooking: 

- Garlic (optional, but garlic naan is the best)
- Ghee or garlic ghee (if you don't have ghee, use butter)
- Fresh chopped cilantro
- Sea salt 

## Supplies

- Stand mixer
- Cast iron pan 
- Roller
- Large bowl 
- Kitchen towel
- Spray bottle with water 
- Bench scraper

## Instructions 

1. Mix the wet ingredients until combined in mixer. If you don't have a mixer, you can do this by hand or with a wooden spoon. 
2. Add flour and salt. The dough will be stiff - that's ok. Mix by hand or in mixer for about 10 minutes until the dough is smooth and has built up some strength. 
3. Cover the bowl with a warm damp kitchen towel and place on counter or in the oven with a light on to bulk proof. 
4. Allow to rise until doubled in size. You can add a couple stretch and folds throughout, but it's not necessary. 
5. Expect a rise time of 6-8 hours depending on temperatures. Because this is an enriched dough, it will rise slower than plain bread dough. 
6. Once risen, turn dough out onto work surface and divide into 8 pieces using dough scraper. They will be about 78-80 g each. 
7. Shape each piece into a ball with the dough scraper and cover them with a light kitchen towel. *Dough can also be stored in a covered container in the fridge for up to 3 days before cooking at this point. Before cooking, allow dough to come back to room temperature.*  
8. Allow dough to rest for about 20-30 min. 
9. While dough is resting, pre-heat cast iron over medium heat for 10-15 minutes. You can use a paper towel and some oil to oil the skillet before each dough (lightly, though). 
10. Work with one dough ball at a time. Roll the dough into a round shape to about 1/8" thickness and 6-8" diameter. You can use some flour if you need to prevent sticking, but you *MUST* brush off all flour before adding to the skillet. If you don't it will burn and make the kitchen a smokey mess! 
11. Place the rolled dough into the skillet and cook for about 1.5-2 minutes. Flip and cook on the second side for about 1-2 minutes. You will see the naan puff up with air. Keep an eye on the bottom - you want the dough to be dark brown and even get a tiny bit of char. But if you leave it too long it will burn, stick to the cast iron, and produce a lot of smoke. 
12. Remove from skillet and place in the oven set to warm directly on the rack until all are cooked. 
13. Once all are cooked, remove the naans and place on a baking sheet or parchment paper. 
14. Brush with ghee and add garlic, cilantro, and sea salt or any other desired toppings. 
15. Eat fresh or store in plastic bag at room temperature for ~2 days or freeze for longer storage.
