# Ariana's sourdough discard crackers

*This recipe makes crispy crackers that you can season any way you like!*

## Ingredients

For the dough:  

- 200 g sourdough starter (can be fed active starter or unfed discard) - *I used active starter*  
- 56 g whole wheat flour (you can also use rye or any other flour you like) 
- 56 g all purpose flour 
- 3 g kosher salt
- 4 Tbps room temperature unsalted butter 

For the seasoning:  

- Olive oil for brushing 
- Flaky sea salt, sesame seeds, or everything bagel seasoning (or any other seasonings you want)  

## Supplies

- Stand mixer
- Plastic wrap
- Roller
- Parchment paper

## Instructions 

1. Mix all dough ingredients in a stand mixer or by hand until dough is smooth and all ingredients are incorporated. 
2. Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Split the dough in half, and shape each into a rectangle. 
3. Dust lightly with flour and wrap each rectangle in plastic wrap. 
4. Place in the fridge for 30 minutes until firm, or up to 24 hours. 
5. When you want to bake, preheat oven to 350Â°F. 
6. Work with one piece of your dough at a time. Unwrap the plastic wrap, reserving it for later. Lightly flour parchment paper, your rolling pin, and the top of the dough. 
7. Place dough onto parchment paper and place the plastic wrap on top of the dough. 
8. Roll the dough *as thinly as possible* and disperse it as evenly as posisble across the whole parchment paper. 
9. Transfer the parchment paper to a baking sheet. 
10. Lightly brush with olive oil and add your seasonings on top. 
11. Cut the dough however you like. I did long strips about 1-1.5 inches wide, which will be great for dipping! 
12. Bake for 20-25 minutes rotating the pan halfway through until starting to brown on the edges. Depending on how thin they are rolled, you may need to adjust the time. *Do not underbake these or they wont be crisp!*  
13. When fully browned, remove from the oven and place the pan on a rack to cool. If they cool on the pan, they will be even crispier. 
14. Repeat with the other piece of dough or keep in the frige until you want to use it. 
15. Store airtight at room temperature for up to a week or in the freezer for long term storage.  
16. Dip in hummus, top with brie, or anything else you can think of!
